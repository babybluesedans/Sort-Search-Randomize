# Sort-Search-Randomize

This program is a work in progress. 

Usage: ./sorter [file-path]

File must be a list of numbers seperated by whitespace values. 

The idea is to create a simple command-line UI program where a user can specify a filepath to a file containing
numbers, and either sort it, search for a number inside of it, or randomize it. 

I plan to get a working prototype with a few basic sort/search/randomize functions, and then expand upon
all of them. A program that can sort a list, randomize that list, search for something in that list,
infinitely. 

I plan to add more complex sorting functions as I learn about them, such as quick sort, radix sort, heap
sort, etc. Users will also be able to see how long each array traversing function takes, and compare them. 

I will also be implementing a option to create a file containing numbers if one is not specified. 

This is also my first test-run with github, as I try to get used to using remote repos.
